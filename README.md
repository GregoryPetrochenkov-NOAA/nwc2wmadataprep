##Data Creation
These data feed a geoserver infrastructure available here: https://labs.waterdata.usgs.gov/geoserver/web/

This initial repository contains source data and assumes access to a locally running PostGres database and GDAL.

It is reccomended to use docker and the following images:

- for local db, psql, and pgdump : mdillon/postgis
- for ogr2ogr: osgeo/gdal:ubuntu-small-latest

Shell scripts are used to download data layers and upload pgdumps to the Artifactory.

Future work includes running the above process in a Jenkins pipeline.

##GeoServer

A sehll script emulates the configuration of a local geoserver.

It is reccomended to use docker and the following images:

- for local geoserver: kartoza/geoserver

Jenkinsfile can be used in a pipeline to automate configuration of a geoserver via an EC2 instance.
